                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">'Ā'isha's network can be presented in 5 layers. Each layer represents the degree of separation from 'Ā'isha, such that the first layer represents those who directly transmitted from 'Ā'isha. The nodes in each orbit tend to grow in number as the degree of separation increases form&nbsp;Ā'isha. This is an expected phenomenon as the number of transmitters increase over time as the hādith spread in the growing community of early Muslims. However, the two outermost orbits do not fully confirm to this rule. This anomaly can be explained by the fact that it only required at the minimum three transmitters between 'Ā'isha's death in 58 AH/678 CE and when al-Bukhari began compiling his hadith collection around 205 AH/820 CE, a period of about 150 years representing three generations. However, hadith was still transmitted intra-generationally, thus often leading to more than 3 transmitters in a chain.<br><br>Further analysing 'Ā'isha's network, we observe that one node stands out above the rest in the first orbit for the number of hadith transmitted from 'Ā'isha. This is 'Urwa ibn al-Zubayr (d. 94 AH/712 CE), 'Ā'isha's nephew and well-known transmitter of her hadith. Let's take a closer look at 'Urwa's network.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">'Urwa is responsible for transmitting 43 hadith, about a third of the 123 hadith in our sample data. 11 transmitters further transmitted on 'Urwa's authority. A quick look at their death dates (ranging between 100-146 AH) shows that they were all plausibly alive as adults during Urwa's life (d. 94 AH). 8 of these are reported to have been present in Medina, where 'Urwa was based. However, the remaining 3 have not been reported to be in Medina, according to the sources used for this data. This raises a concern for us: either something is missing in our data or the chain of transmission is suspicious. The three possibliities for us are as follows,<br><br>1. Missing data: Since all three anomalies are from the same place, it is possible that either 'Urwa made a visit to Kufa or the three transmitters came to Medina at some point, which has not been recorded in the sources. This possibility can be further investigating historical sources.<br><br>2. Missing link: It is possible that someone who transmitted from 'Urwa to his Kufan transmitters did not make part of the isnād for some reason. While the likelihood of three people forgetting to add to their isnād is somewhat unlikely, there could be other motivations at play to omit this mystery transmitter from the isnād (e.g. religious differences). This possibility can be evaluated through a closer analysis of this network with a larger data set to see if any missing links show up.<br><br>3. Forgery: The very last possibility is that the links to 'Urwa were forged by the Kufan transmitters, thus casting doubt on the contents of the hadith they ultimately transmitted. This possibility, of course, is the hardest to prove and can only be entertained if our first two possibilities completely fail to pan out.&nbsp;<br><br>At this point, hopefully the complexity and enormity of hadith criticism is evident. Our network analysis has helped us circle out these discrepancies that might be hard to catch otherwise.&nbsp;<br><br>Moving on, out of the 11 transmitters who transmitted from 'Urwa, two stand out to us, al-Zuhri and Hishām ibn 'Urwa. Let's dive into Hishām's network. Remember, we are now two degrees removed from 'Ā'isha!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Hishām had 9 transmitters, including Imām Mālik, another compiler of one of the six authentic compilations. Leaving aside Mālik, do you notice anything common among rest of Hishām's transmitters? They all are from Iraq! And almost all, except for one, are from Kufa. However, our sources show Hishām's location as Medina. What happened here? How did all the Iraqi transmitters transmit hadith on Hishām's authority when they presumably were not in the same place as Hishām?&nbsp;<br><br>Thankfully, our task this time turned out to be easier. A quick look into scholarship pertaining to Hishām shows that he in fact died in Baghdad, after spending most of his life in Medina. Moreover, hadith transmission had become a fully developed enterprise by this point in Islamic history, and thus, it is possible that people travelled to learn from&nbsp;Hishām due to the large number of hadith he reportedly knew.&nbsp;<br><br>Next, we will shift our focus to a different aspect of the network: the transmitters who appear only at the end of an isnād.<br><br></p>

Even more peculiar is the fact that he appears only two degrees separated from 'Ā'isha, whereas almost all of the remaining transmitters show up at least three degrees separated from&nbsp;Ā'isha. Moreover, ibn Abī Shayba died in 235 AH, almost 180 years after&nbsp;Ā'isha, making it highly unlikely that he was only two degrees separated from 'Ā'isha. Something is off here!</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Looking closer into the the chain that landed him in the second orbit reveals that the problem lies somewhere else. 'Abdullah ibn Numayr al-Qasim, on whose authority Abu Bakr transmitted, died in 199 AH but shows up in our data as reporting one hadith directly from 'Ā'isha, which would be impossible since she died in 58 AH. Out of the five hadith reported by Namīr, the remaining 4 a have been reported on the authority of al-Qasim ibn Muhammad who died in 108 AH, thus making his interaction with 'Ā'isha certainly plausible. At this point, we can safely conclude that the isnād of one hadith which shows Namīr as direct transmitter from 'Ā'isha is certainly faulty. <br><br>Given that the remaining four hadith transmitted on the authority of Abū Bakr in fact contain plausible isnāds, we can rule out the possibility that Abū Bakr was trying to falsify any information. The omission then very likely happened at Abū Bakr's end. Whether this was an honest mistake or an intentional omission is anyone's guess based on our current data.<br><br>The rest of&nbsp;Abū Bakr's network also presents an intriguing example. We observe that six of his transmitters, shown on his right in this diagram, do not interact with anyone else in his network. The remaining 15 seem to be interacting with each other in a complex web of interactions. Thus, the former six transmitters present a possible area of investigation to determine why they were not part of the remaining network, unless additional data modifies this observation.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>These examples present only a fraction of what can be done using network analysis for hadith studies. While it might seem that our conclusions are far from conclusive, the fact is that they open up important avenues for further investigation. Researching pre-modern history is a slow and painstaking process after all, and these examples hope to show a glimpse of the challenges faced by historians in this field and some suggestions to meaningfully tackle them with the help of digital tools.&nbsp;</strong></p>
